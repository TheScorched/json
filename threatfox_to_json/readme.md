# threatfox API to JSON
# threatfox allows threat hunters to export IOC data in CSV format
# I prefer JSON so I can import to my SIEM easier

Simple method to get threat data via API, process the data, and export it as a JSON. 
JSON is much more managable to ingest into SIEM tools vs csv or raw text. 
Currently the python scripts are coded for ThreatFox but should be easy to change to meet your needs. 

!!!!Ensure all scripts are stored in the same directory!!!
