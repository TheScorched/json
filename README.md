# why
As a Splunk engineer I deal with different data formats. 
I wanted to consolidate all of my JSON scripts into one repo.
Please enjoy and let me know how I can improve my coding skills. Cheers. 

# threatfox_to_json
Lets you take data from the threatfox database, download it, 
and then lets you sculpt it into a JSON file.
From here you can ingest with ease.

# turtle
As the name implies, this is a line-by-line approach.
Labor intensive indeed. This stemmed from a project where 
I was creating synthetic network data that was not consistent as
far as "structured" data goes. Needed to whip something up that was...
flexible? idk. let me know if there is another way.
